@POTUS,2/24/22,"I spoke with the G7 leaders today, and we are in full agreement: We will limit Russia’s ability to be part of the global economy. We will stunt their ability to finance and grow Russia’s military. We will impair their ability to compete in a high-tech, 21st century economy."
@POTUS,2/24/22,We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on the Russian currency — the ruble — which early today hit its weakest level ever. The Russian stock market plunged today. And the Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked above 15 percent.
@POTUS,2/25/22,We have been transparent with the world — we shared declassified intelligence about Russia’s plans and cyber attacks and false pretexts — so that there can be no confusion or cover up. Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war.
@POTUS,2/25/22,"Today, I authorized a new round of sanctions and limitations in response to Putin’s war of choice against Ukraine. We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia – and to minimize the impact on the United States."
@POTUS,2/25/22,"The next few days, weeks, and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine. Putin has unleashed a great pain on them. But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence — and they have shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards."
@POTUS,2/26/22,"Today, I met with fellow leaders from our NATO Allies and spoke with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The United States continues to provide economic, humanitarian, and security support–and we continue to rally other countries to provide similar assistance."
@POTUS,2/28/22,I spoke today with Allies and partners to discuss Russia’s unprovoked war on Ukraine. We are continuing our support for the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and affirmed our readiness to keep imposing severe costs on Russia if they do not de-escalate.
@POTUS,3/1/22,"I just spoke with President Zelenskyy to discuss our continued support for Ukraine — including security assistance and humanitarian aid — as it defends itself against Russian aggression. We will hold Russia accountable, and our sanctions are already having a devastating impact."
@POTUS,3/2/22,"President Putin thought he could roll into Ukraine — and the world would roll over. Instead, he met a wall of strength he never imagined. He met the Ukrainian people."
@POTUS,3/2/22,"The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. We are joining with our European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We are coming for their ill-begotten gains."
@POTUS,3/2/22,"Together with our allies, we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance. And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering."
@POTUS,3/2/22,"When the history of this era is written, Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger."
@POTUS,3/2/22,The United States of America stands with the Ukrainian people.
@POTUS,3/3/22,"Putin thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond — and he thought he could divide us at home. He was wrong. I spent countless hours unifying our European Allies. We countered Russia’s lies with truth. And now, the free world is holding him accountable."
@POTUS,3/3/22,"This afternoon, I’ll be meeting with my Cabinet at the White House. We’ll be discussing additional sanctions on Russian oligarchs, our plans to lower costs for Americans, our unity agenda, and more."
@POTUS,3/3/22,"In my State of the Union Address, I said the United States is going after the crimes of Russian oligarchs. Today, we’re adding dozens of names to the list — and banning travel to America by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families, and close associates."
@POTUS,3/4/22,I look forward to hosting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö at the White House this afternoon for a bilateral meeting. We’ll be discussing the latest developments regarding Russia’s war on Ukraine and how to strengthen European security.
@POTUS,3/8/22,Watch live as I announce actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/8/22,"Today, I’m announcing that the United States is targeting a main artery of Russia’s economy."
@POTUS,3/8/22,"This decision today is not without costs here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the pump — and this will drive up costs further. So, I will take every step we can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home."
@POTUS,3/8/22,"Let me say to the oil and gas companies and finance firms that back them: We understand that Putin’s war against the people of Ukraine is causing prices to rise. But that is no excuse for excess price increases, or padding profits, or any kind of effort to exploit this situation."
@POTUS,3/8/22,We are enforcing an enormous package of economic sanctions that has caused the Russian economy to crater. The Russian ruble is down almost 50 percent since Putin announced his war. It is now worth less than one American penny.
@POTUS,3/8/22,"Over the last week, I’ve spoken with President Zelenskyy several times to hear from him about the situation on the ground and consult on continuing U.S. support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We have provided more than $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/9/22,Russian oil will no longer be accepted at U.S. ports — and the American people will deal another powerful blow against Putin’s war machine.
@POTUS,3/9/22,This much is already clear: Ukraine will never be a victory for Putin. Putin may be able to take a city — but he will never be able to hold the country.
@POTUS,3/9/22,"Loosening environmental regulations won’t lower prices. But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles, powered by clean energy, will mean that no one will have to worry about gas prices. It will mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as a weapon."
@POTUS,3/9/22,"If we do not respond to Putin’s assault on global peace and stability today, the cost to freedom and to the American people will be even greater tomorrow. We will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war against the Ukrainian people."
@POTUS,3/10/22,"Since Putin began his military buildup on Ukrainian borders, the price of gas at the pump in America went up 75 cents. Here’s Putin’s price hike explained:"
@POTUS,3/10/22,I spoke today with @RTErdogan to coordinate our responses to Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine. We discussed the importance of continued international efforts to hold Moscow accountable for its aggression and to support the Ukrainian people as they confront this crisis.
@POTUS,3/11/22,Watch live as I announce actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/11/22,"These are the latest steps we are taking, but they will not be the last. And as I said at the beginning, all of these steps will hit Putin harder because the United States and our closest Allies and partners are acting in unison."
@POTUS,3/11/22,"While we’re going after their superyachts and vacation homes that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, we’re also going to make it harder for them to buy the high-end products manufactured in our countries. We’re banning the export of luxury goods to Russia."
@POTUS,3/11/22,"Later today, together with the other nations of the G7 and the EU, we will jointly announce several new steps to squeeze Putin and to hold him accountable for his aggression against Ukraine. I want to speak to a few key points."
@POTUS,3/11/22,The totality of our sanctions is crushing the Russian economy. The ruble has lost more than half its value. The list of private businesses leaving Russia is growing by the day.
@POTUS,3/11/22,"I called @ZelenskyyUa this morning to discuss our ongoing security, humanitarian, and economic assistance for the Ukrainian people. I updated him on the actions we are taking today in coordination with the G7 and EU to further raise the costs on Russia for its attack on Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/11/22,I want to be clear: We will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO. But we will not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine. A direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III. And something we must strive to prevent.
@POTUS,3/11/22,Putin’s war against Ukraine will never be a victory. He hoped to dominate Ukraine without a fight. He hoped to fracture European resolve. He hoped to weaken the trans-Atlantic Alliance. He hoped to split apart America. He failed.
@POTUS,3/11/22,"Last night, Congress passed a bipartisan spending bill that included an additional $13.6 billion in new assistance for the Ukrainian people. I look forward to signing that immediately."
@POTUS,3/12/22,"As Putin continues his merciless assault, the United States and our allies and partners continue to work in lockstep to ramp up the economic pressure on Putin and to further isolate Russia on the global stage."
@POTUS,3/14/22,We are continuing the close cooperation with Allies and partners to make sure that the Ukrainian people can defend their nation. The United States has committed more than $1.2 billion in security assistance to Ukraine over the last year.
@POTUS,3/14/22,"We’re working closely with the UN and humanitarian organizations to support people who have been displaced by the violence in Ukraine. We’re providing tens of thousands of tons of humanitarian supplies — food, water, medicines — coming in every day."
@POTUS,3/15/22,We will make sure Ukraine has weapons to defend against the invading Russian force. We will send money and food and aid to save Ukrainian lives. We will welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms.
@POTUS,3/15/22,I just signed the Bipartisan Government Funding Bill into law — keeping the government open and providing a historic $13.6 billion in funding to Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/15/22,Putin’s aggression against Ukraine has united people across America and the world to act with urgency and resolve. I want to thank Congressional leadership for working so quickly to make sure we have the resources we need to continue our forceful response to this crisis.
@POTUS,3/15/22,This war has turned nearly 3 million Ukrainians into refugees. That’s on top of more than 12 million people who require humanitarian assistance inside Ukraine. The United States is helping to lead a global humanitarian response with our partners in Europe and beyond.
@POTUS,3/16/22,Watch live as I deliver remarks announcing new assistance the United States is providing to Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/16/22,The United States and our allies and partners are fully committed to surging weapons and assistance to Ukraine. And more will be coming as we source additional stocks of equipment that is ready to transfer.
@POTUS,3/16/22,"And it will include drones, which demonstrates our commitment to sending our most cutting-edge systems to Ukraine for its defense."
@POTUS,3/16/22,"Putin is inflicting appalling devastation and horror on Ukraine — bombing apartment buildings and maternity wards. Yesterday, we saw reports that Russian forces were holding hundreds of doctors and patients hostage. These are atrocities. It is an outrage to the world."
@POTUS,3/17/22,The package I announced today will provide unprecedented assistance to Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/17/22,The world is united in our support for Ukraine — and in our determination to make Putin pay a very heavy price for attacking Ukraine. America is leading this effort — together with our allies and partners — providing enormous levels of security and humanitarian assistance.
@POTUS,3/21/22,"I’ve previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the U.S. Today, I’m reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks."
@POTUS,3/21/22,"I spoke with President Macron, Chancellor Scholz of Germany, Prime Minister Draghi, and Prime Minister Johnson today to discuss our coordinated responses to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, and our ongoing support for the Ukrainian people."
@POTUS,3/22/22,"The federal government is doing its part to get ready for potential Russian cyberattacks. We are prepared to help private sector companies with tools and expertise, but it is your decision as to the steps you’ll take and your responsibility to take them."
@POTUS,3/22/22,"On this trip we will make clear that the West is united in our defense of democracy. Putin thought he would divide us, but we are stronger than at any time in recent history. We stand with Ukraine and we will continue to ensure Putin pays a heavy economic price for his actions."
@POTUS,3/22/22,Then I’ll travel to Poland to hold a bilateral meeting with President @AndrzejDuda. I look forward to discussing our response to the humanitarian and human rights crisis Russia has created in Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/22/22,"Tomorrow, I’m traveling to Europe to meet with our allies and partners exactly one month after Putin accelerated his brutal war in Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/23/22,President Biden is on his way to Europe to meet with our allies and partners in response to Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine. Amanda Sloat from @POTUS’s National Security team previews his trip:
@POTUS,3/23/22,I’m on my way to Europe to rally the international community in support of Ukraine and ensure Putin pays a severe economic cost for his war of choice.
@POTUS,3/24/22,Thank you Prime Minister @alexanderdecroo for the warm welcome in Brussels. I'm looking forward to our work together — with all our Allies and partners — this week as we continue responding to Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/24/22,"Today in Brussels I’m meeting with our NATO Allies, G7 members, and the European Council to discuss our ongoing response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine. We stand united in defense of democracy and with the people of Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/24/22,NATO leaders met today in Brussels — one month since the start of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. We will continue to support Ukraine with security assistance to fight Russian aggression and uphold their right of self-defense.
@POTUS,3/24/22,"I met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg today to address Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. We discussed the unity and strength of the alliance, NATO’s ongoing efforts to deter and defend against any aggression, and our support for Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/24/22,"I’m announcing additional sanctions on over 400 Russian elites, lawmakers, and defense companies in response to Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine. They personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies, and they should share in the pain."
@POTUS,3/24/22,I was proud to meet with my fellow G7 leaders today. We remain resolved to stand with the Ukrainian people and government who heroically resist President Putin’s military aggression and war of choice against their sovereign nation.
@POTUS,3/24/22,Tune in as I hold a press conference about my meetings in Europe with Allies and partners on our response to Russia’s war on Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/24/22,"Today, I announced that the United States will welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russia’s aggression. We’re focused on reuniting families and providing refuge to those in harm’s way."
@POTUS,3/25/22,"Putin was banking on NATO being split, but it has never been more united than it is today."
@POTUS,3/25/22,"Today, I participated in a European Council meeting in Brussels. We committed to providing further humanitarian assistance to those fleeing violence in Ukraine and to continue imposing economic costs on Russia for its actions."
@POTUS,3/25/22,"It was an honor to meet with European Commission President von der Leyen this morning. We are united in our condemnation of Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Together, we announced new steps to reduce Europe’s dependency on Russian energy."
@POTUS,3/25/22,"Today, we’re launching a new partnership with the European Commission to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels."
@POTUS,3/25/22,Watch live as I receive a briefing on the humanitarian response to ease the suffering of civilians inside Ukraine and to respond to the growing flow of refugees fleeing Putin’s war of choice.
@POTUS,3/25/22,"This afternoon in Poland, I received a briefing on the humanitarian response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States is prepared to provide an additional $1 billion for humanitarian assistance and welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainians and others fleeing Russian aggression."
@POTUS,3/25/22,"Today, we announced a new groundbreaking initiative between the European Union and the United States to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russian energy."
@POTUS,3/26/22,"Today, I met with Ukraine’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Defense — and with Polish President Andrzej Duda. I’m visiting a refugee site to see our humanitarian efforts. Tonight, I’m delivering remarks on our commitment to a future rooted in democratic principles."
@POTUS,3/26/22,"Today, I met with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Minister of Defense Oleksii Reznikov. We discussed our efforts to rally the world in support of Ukraine and the significant military and humanitarian assistance the United States is providing."
@POTUS,3/26/22,"Today, I met with Polish President Andrzej Duda in Warsaw. I thanked him and the people of Poland for opening their homes and hearts to their neighbors in need. And we discussed our shared commitment to support the people and government of Ukraine."
@POTUS,3/26/22,"I visited Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Poland this afternoon. You don’t need to speak the same language to feel the roller-coaster of emotions in their eyes. I want to thank my friend Chef José Andrés, his team, and the people of Warsaw for opening your hearts to help."
@POTUS,3/26/22,"Watch live as I deliver remarks on the united efforts of the free world to support the people of Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its brutal war, and defend a future that is rooted in democratic principles."
@POTUS,3/26/22,We are engaged anew in a great battle for freedom. A battle between democracy and autocracy. Between liberty and repression. This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.
@POTUS,3/26/22,"The brave Ukrainian resistance is a front in a larger fight: for the essential democratic principles that unite all free people. These principles are essential for a free society, but have always been embattled. Every generation has had to defeat democracy’s mortal foes."
@POTUS,3/26/22,I have come to Europe with a clear and determined message: We must commit now to be in this fight for democracy for the long haul. We must be unified today and tomorrow. History shows that this is the task of our time – of this generation.
@POTUS,3/26/22,My message to the people of Ukraine is the message I delivered today to the Ukrainian Foreign Minister and Defense Minister: We stand with you.
@POTUS,3/26/22,"Putin — like all autocrats before him — believes that might makes right. President Abraham Lincoln voiced an opposing spirit to save our Union: “Let us have faith that right makes might.” Today, let us have that faith again."
@POTUS,3/26/22,Putin has the gall to say he is “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. This lie isn’t just cynical. It is obscene. President Zelenskyy was democratically elected. He is Jewish — his father’s family was wiped out in the Nazi Holocaust.
@POTUS,3/27/22,"As a result of our unprecedented sanctions, the ruble was almost immediately reduced to rubble. The Russian economy is on track to be cut in half. It was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion — and soon, it will not even rank among the top 20."
@POTUS,3/27/22,To the Russian people: You are not our enemy. The American people stand with you and the brave citizens in Ukraine who want peace.
@POTUS,3/27/22,We are here for the people of Ukraine.
@POTUS,3/27/22,"In the year before the invasion, America had sent $650 million in weapons to Ukraine — and since, we have committed to another $1.35 billion. Thanks to the courage and bravery of the Ukrainian people, the equipment we have sent them has been used to devastating effect."
@POTUS,3/27/22,Ukraine and its people are on the front lines fighting to save their nation. And their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for the essential democratic principles that unite all free people.
@POTUS,3/27/22,"Helping Ukrainian refugees is not something Poland or any nation should carry alone. All the world’s democracies have a responsibility to help. And the people of Ukraine can count on the United States to meet its responsibility. We will welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees."
@POTUS,3/27/22,Let us resolve to put the strengths of democracy into action to thwart the designs of autocracy.
@POTUS,3/27/22,The brave Ukrainian people are showing that the power of many is greater than the will of any one dictator.
@POTUS,3/27/22,"Let there be no doubt that this war has already been a strategic failure for Russia. Putin thought Ukrainians would roll over and not fight. Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance."
@POTUS,3/27/22,"Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia’s brutal tactics have only strengthened it. Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it has ever been."
@POTUS,3/27/22,A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people’s love for liberty. Brutality will never grind down their will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia.
@POTUS,3/27/22,"In times of crisis, we often see the best in humanity. I want to thank my friend Chef José Andrés, his team at World Central Kitchen, and everyone on the ground for all they’re doing to support Ukrainian refugees."
@POTUS,3/27/22,I went to Europe with a clear message: We must commit now to be in the fight for democracy for the long haul. We stand with the people of Ukraine and we will continue to ensure Russia pays a severe price for its war of choice.
@POTUS,4/6/22,"I made clear that Russia would pay a severe and immediate price for its atrocities in Bucha. Today, along with our Allies and partners, we’re announcing a new round of devastating sanctions."
@POTUS,4/8/22,"After its atrocities in Ukraine, Russia has no place on the UN Human Rights Council. Today, we made that clear."
@POTUS,4/8/22,"In addition to U.S.-produced weapons, we have also worked to facilitate the transfer of capabilities from our Allies and partners around the world. I want to thank the Slovakian government for providing an S-300 air defense system to Ukraine."
@POTUS,4/8/22,"Since the outset of my Administration, the United States has placed the highest priority on delivering critical military capabilities to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian aggression. The entire world has now witnessed the effectiveness of those weapons."
@POTUS,4/8/22,"We will continue our security assistance and weapons deliveries to help Ukraine defend their country. And, together with our allies and partners, we will support efforts to investigate this attack as we document Russia’s actions and hold them accountable."
@POTUS,4/8/22,"The attack on a Ukrainian train station is yet another horrific atrocity committed by Russia, striking civilians who were trying to evacuate and reach safety."
@POTUS,4/13/22,Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. 70% of the increase in prices in March came from the Putin Price Hike. I’m doing everything I can to bring down prices and address the Putin Price Hike.
@POTUS,4/13/22,"Today, I spoke with President Zelenskyy and shared with him that my Administration is authorizing an additional $800 million in weapons, ammunition, and other security assistance to Ukraine."
@POTUS,4/19/22,"This morning, I met with Allies and partners to discuss our support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. We are committed to continuing our assistance and to imposing severe economic costs on Russia — and we reaffirmed our solidarity with the Ukrainian people."
@POTUS,4/21/22,Tune in as I provide an update on our efforts to support the people of Ukraine and announce additional assistance.
@POTUS,4/21/22,I met with Prime Minister Shmyhal of Ukraine this morning to convey our continued commitment to support Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal war of aggression.
@POTUS,4/21/22,"Today, I am announcing another $800 million to further augment Ukraine’s ability to fight in the East. This package will include heavy artillery weapons, dozens of howitzers, and 144,000 rounds of ammunition to go with them. It also includes more tactical drones."
@POTUS,4/21/22,"In the past two months, we have moved weapons and equipment to Ukraine at record speed. The United States alone has provided 10 anti-armor systems for every one Russian tank that is in Ukraine."
@POTUS,4/21/22,"Today, the United States is announcing that we intend to provide an additional $500 million in direct economic assistance to the Ukrainian government. This brings our total economic support for Ukraine to $1 billion in the past two months."
@POTUS,4/21/22,This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians. This program will be fast. It will be streamlined. And it will ensure the United States honors our commitment to the Ukrainian people.
@POTUS,4/21/22,"We’ve already welcomed tens of thousands of Ukrainians to the United States. And today, I’m announcing “Uniting for Ukraine,” a new program to enable Ukrainians seeking refuge to come directly from Europe to the United States."
@POTUS,4/22/22,"Yesterday, the Treasury Department rolled out additional measures to crack down on entities and individuals attempting to evade our unprecedented sanctions. And today, I announced that the United States will ban Russian-affiliated ships from our ports."
@POTUS,4/22/22,"Our unity at home, our unity with our Allies and partners, and our unity with the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine."
@POTUS,4/22/22,The Battle of Kyiv was a historic victory for the Ukrainians. It was a victory for freedom won by the Ukrainian people with unprecedented assistance by the United States and our Allies and partners.
@POTUS,4/22/22,"Every American taxpayer, every member of our Armed Forces can be proud of the fact that our country’s generosity — and the skill and service of our troops — helped arm Ukraine to repel Russia’s aggression."
@POTUS,4/22/22,The sustained and coordinated support of the international community — led and facilitated by the United States — is a significant reason why Ukraine has been able to stop Russia from taking over their country.
@POTUS,4/22/22,"As Russia continues to grind out brutalities against Ukraine, Putin is banking on us losing interest. He is betting that Western unity will crack. Once again, we will prove him wrong."
@POTUS,4/22/22,"Yesterday, I announced additional support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression."
@POTUS,4/24/22,"Two months after Putin launched an unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, Kyiv still stands. President Zelenskyy and his democratically-elected government remain in power. We will continue to support Ukrainians in their fight to defend their homeland."
@POTUS,4/25/22,"Congratulations to @EmmanuelMacron on his re-election. France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges. I look forward to our continued close cooperation — including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change."
@POTUS,4/28/22,Tune in as I deliver remarks on support for Ukrainians defending their country and their freedom against Russia’s brutal war.
@POTUS,4/28/22,"I just signed a request to Congress for critical security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to help Ukraine continue to counter Putin’s aggression at a pivotal moment. We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom."
@POTUS,4/28/22,"Despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for all to see: We are not attacking Russia. We are helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression. And just as Putin chose to launch this brutal invasion, he could make the choice to end it."
@POTUS,4/28/22,"Russia’s assault has yielded immense human costs. We’ve seen them leave behind horrifying evidence of their atrocities and war crimes in the areas they tried to control. In the face of these atrocities, we will continue to supply military assistance to Ukraine."
@POTUS,4/28/22,"This assistance would provide even more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor, and anti-air capabilities. And it would deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance like food, water, medicines, shelter, and other aid. I hope Congress will pass this funding request quickly."
@POTUS,4/28/22,"In order to sustain Ukraine as it continues this fight, I am sending to Congress a supplemental budget request. It will keep weapons and ammunition flowing to the brave Ukrainian fighters and continue delivering economic and humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people."
@POTUS,4/29/22,"We are working with other nations — like South Korea, Japan, and Qatar — that support our effort to help our European allies threatened by Russia with gas blackmail meet their energy needs in other ways.
Aggression will not win. Threats will not win."
@POTUS,4/29/22,"Yesterday, Russia threatened two of our allies with a cut off of energy supplies. Let me be clear: We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of sanctions. And we will not allow them to use their oil to avoid consequences for their aggression."
@POTUS,4/29/22,It’s critical my funding request gets approved as quickly as possible. We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and aggression.
@POTUS,4/29/22,My supplemental funding request will ensure our support for the Ukrainian military continues during the crucial weeks and months ahead.
@POTUS,4/30/22,"I’ve always had respect for the press, but I can’t say enough about how much respect I have after their reporting in Ukraine. They’re risking their lives every single day to make sure the world hears the truth."
@POTUS,4/30/22,"As we continue to deliver critical support to Ukraine, we must also not let our guard down in the fight against COVID-19 at home and abroad."
@POTUS,5/3/22,Tune in as I deliver remarks on the security assistance we are providing to Ukraine.
@POTUS,5/3/22,"Since Russia attacked Ukraine just over two months ago, we have sent more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. That money is a direct investment in defending freedom and democracy itself."
@POTUS,5/3/22,"Last week, I sent Congress a supplemental budget request to make sure we can continue to send Ukraine weapons and continue to provide economic and humanitarian assistance. I urge Congress to pass this funding quickly to help Ukraine defend against ongoing Russian aggression."
@POTUS,5/4/22,"Today, I visited a Lockheed Martin factory in Alabama that’s building the Javelin missiles we’re sending to Ukraine. The weapons built here — now in the hands of Ukrainian heroes — are making all the difference. That’s something we can all be proud of."
@POTUS,5/5/22,"This week, I visited a Javelin missile factory in Alabama to thank them for all they’re doing to support Ukraine."
@POTUS,5/7/22,"Today, the U.S. is continuing our strong support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country. I am announcing another package of security assistance that will provide additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine."
@POTUS,5/8/22,"Today, I spoke with G7 Leaders and President Zelenskyy about our ironclad unity and commitment to keep strengthening Ukraine and ratcheting up the pain on Putin."
