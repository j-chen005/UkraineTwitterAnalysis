@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"In the hours to come #Russia will -conduct strikes on air defense systems -move to cut off #Kyiv from eastern #Ukraine -move to cut off Ukraine’s military forces on the line of contact in the east to prevent them from falling back to defend Kyiv



I hope we are learning a valuable lesson with #Ukraine 

We need to produce our own energy, make things again & not depend on #Russia & #China"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"#Putin thinks #Russia’s troops will be greeted as liberators

He may soon find out occupying #Ukraine is about as fun as eating a porcupine"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,The #Russian invasion of #Ukraine is now underway
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"The people of #Ukraine are tough people who will NEVER accept being ruled by #Putin Men,women,children,the elderly,they are going to fight And they are going to maim & kill alot of Russians"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"#Russia’s airborne forces are attempting to take control of the airport in #Kyiv to they can fly in forces to occupy the capitol city An amphibious assault on the key port city of #Mariupol is now underway Ground forces now moving in from Belarus,Crimea & from #Russia"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"#Russia is now working on:
 
-establishing air superiority via targeted surgical strikes
-a pincer movement to trap Ukrainian forces in the east & cut them off from #Kyiv 
-finally attempt to decapitate Ukrainian govt by targeting govt buildings,leaders & command & control systems"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,Russian aircraft are now en route to conduct additional targeted strikes on a number of key defense sites through all of #Ukraine
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,Long range missile launches from #Russia are now underway They are headed towards various pre-selected military sites throughout #Ukraine
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"To clarify what is underway is a full scale & comprehensive military assault throughout #Ukraine Airborne & amphibious landings,missile strikes from air,ground & naval forces, electronic & cyber attacks & a large ground force to occupy a large swath of territory"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"Seen this argument below in various places & it’s simply not true A pledge that #Ukraine would never join NATO was not Putin’s only demand As recently as last week he once again demanded NATO leave every country that joined after 1997 including Bulgaria, Romania & 12 others"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,#Russia isn’t just focused on seizing eastern #Ukraine Russian military forces are working towards isolating #Kyiv at this very moment
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,#Russia has now created a new front in northern #Ukraine with assistance from #Belarus This is part of the plan to carry out a double envelopment of Ukrainian forces in the east & isolate #Kyiv
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,#Ukraine is outgunned and outmanned But they are brave & tough fighters and as the world will soon learn they have already inflicted damage on Russian invaders
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,One very concerning development is #Russia has carried out a few targeted operations uncomfortably close to the Polish border This is the danger of miscalculation & human error that can quickly lead to a catastrophic escalation
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,5. #Putin nuclear threat last night was not a surprise. For years now #Russia’s military doctrine in a war against NATO calls for the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in order to “escalate to deescalate” & force a negotiated ceasefire. (5of5)
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,4. #Russia has 3 objectives over the next 72 hours -encircle & cut off #Ukraine forces in the east -deny Ukraine the ability to resupply via airports and the Black Sea - Set the stage to install a pro-Russian interim government in #Kyiv (4of5)
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,3. #Russia is carrying out deliberate strikes on civilian targets. The purpose is to demoralize the population & diminish the will to resist. (3of5)
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"2. #Russia has launched several attacks on Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia & Lutsk, cities very close to #Ukraine’s borders with NATO countries Romania,Poland & Slovakia. Just one mistake,miscalculation or misunderstanding could set off a broader & catastrophic conflict (2of5)"
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,#Ukraine update: 1. #Russia’s invasion has already taken longer & been costlier than #Putin expected. Almost certain his military & intel leaders knew this ahead of time but no one dared tell him his expectations were unrealistic (1of5)
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,Climate change religious zealot John Kerry is worried that the first major ground war in Europe in 80 years & #Putin’s threat of nuclear consequences is getting more attention than his climate agenda
@marcorubio,2/24/2022,"#Russia plans to encircle #Kyiv, force the legitimate govt of #Ukraine to flee & install “Vichy Ukranian”puppets Key to this plan is a large #Russian Airborne Forces operation We may see an attempt to execute on that operation within a matter of hours #UkraineRussiaConflict"
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,One day the world will be awed when it hears the stories of the bravery and heroism happening at this very moment in #Ukraine
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,"We have only seen the opening phase of #Putin’s barbaric plan,but it has been more difficult than he expected There are now indications #Kyiv may soon be the focus of his rage, and then the entire world would come face to face with a depravity not seen in 80 years"
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,Today #Putin started to learn what I tweeted yesterday #Ukraine will not be easy to invade And Ukrainians will be impossible to conquer
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,These people on tv who keep saying this all could have been avoided if only we would have agreed to never allow #Ukraine to join NATO either don’t know what they are talking about or are lying
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,Appears at least three dozen missiles have been fired at #Kyiv area in the last 40 minutes
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,"The courage,strength & determination of the people of #Ukraine is inspiring the world,revealing the moral laziness of many in the West & exposing #Putin’s sadistic criminality"
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,Alarming development today as #Russia is enforcing illegitimate maritime claims in the Black Sea by attacking foreign commercial ships This is about denying #Ukraine resupplies But it creates the potential for dangerous escalation if NATO is forced to send naval escorts
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,#Kharkiv is under an assault so inhumane in its targeting it feels demonically inspired
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,"The first 48 hours of #Putin’s plan envisioned not getting bogged down in cities,capturing #Kyiv,eliminating top govt leaders & a puppet “Supreme Council” assuming control of #Ukraine Well as a great philosopher once said “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face”"
@marcorubio,2/25/2022,"This is a very dangerous moment #Putin is increasingly angry & isolated And NATO is outraged by his barbarity & feels increasingly threatened by his actions At some point someone is going to take actions they may not view as an attack, but that the other side does"
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,Multiple indications that the largest assault yet on #Kyiv has begun #Ukraine will fight without retreat Historic acts of patriotic bravery are occurring right now
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,Tonight and for weeks to come #Ukraine has a few “Welcome to #Kyiv” surprise gifts for their uninvited guests
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,"Out of curiosity, does anyone know how many #Putin paratroopers a Russian II-76 usually carries? Asking for a friend."
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,"I am requesting that the Biden Admin preemptively announce that anyone who joins a puppet Russian installed govt in #Ukraine be automatically sanctioned,receive a visa ban & will be the subject of an Interpol Red Notice I ask other nations to do the same"
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,"I wish I could share more,but for now I can say it’s pretty obvious to many that something is off with #Putin He has always been a killer,but his problem now is different & significant It would be a mistake to assume this Putin would react the same way he would have 5 years ago"
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,#Russia’s invaders are working their way towards the center of #Kyiv They aren’t going to be very happy if when day breaks & they realize they have been cut off & are now trapped by thousands of pissed of #Ukranians
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,#Putin’s inner circle went along with a #UkraineInvasion plan they knew was unrealistic & could lead to a quagmire Soon the may have to decide whether to go along with new orders that will make them internationally wanted war criminals for the rest of their lives
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,"Churchill’s resolve & British courage during “the Blitz” transformed public opinion in America & inspired the world Now eight decades later, it’s #Ukraine"
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,Reports say #Russia troops apparently moving in vicinity of large nuclear power plant in #Ukraine If confirmed this is a worrisome sign because a “radiological crisis” instigated by the Ukrainian government is among the false flag contingencies #Putin has contemplated
@marcorubio,2/26/2022,#Russia has now deployed TOS-1 launchers to the outskirts of heavily populated areas Thermobaric weapons against civilian targets have zero military purpose It would be a war crime aimed at terrorizing & slaughtering people into submission
@marcorubio,2/27/2022,Thank you to the many network & independent journalists who have put themselves in harms way to bring both the harsh truth & the inspiring stories emerging from the #UkraineInvasion We are praying for your safety
@marcorubio,2/27/2022,"We know what #Putin’s plan was: - air dominance in first 12 hours - Destroy #Ukraine military comms in 36 hours - Bypass major urban areas,cut off Eastern Army,encircle #Kyiv & get govt to flee within 48 hours -Install puppet govt within 72 hours He is still 0 for 4"
@marcorubio,2/27/2022,#Russian military leaders should think very carefully before following the orders they recently received #Putin is 2 years shy of the life expectancy of a Russian male and you will spend the rest of your lives evading an international tribunal for committing his crimes
@marcorubio,2/27/2022,I hope we have a negotiated diplomatic end to the carnage in #Ukraine But I know that for #Putin “negotiations” are simply another tool in his military arsenal. He will use them to buy time to move reinforcements & rebuild supply lines
@marcorubio,2/27/2022,Let me stress again that we are NOT dealing with 2008 #Putin It is a grave error to assume he will make the same calculations & decisions today that he would have made in the past The old Putin was a cold blooded but calculating killer This new Putin is even more dangerous
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,"It’s a mistake to view #Putin threats are just posturing If they find themselves losing in a conventional war #Russia military doctrine calls for escalation to force negotiations by using non-strategic short-range missiles,artillery shells & land mines with nuclear warheads."
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,No matter what happens militarily #Putin won’t win His goal is to get rid of the current govt & replace it with Pro-Russian traitors But he will have to destroy #Ukraine to topple the government And the Ukrainian people will never accept being governed by Putin puppets
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,I will be filing a bill to sanction & issue a lifetime visa ban for any govt official in #Ukraine who collaborates with #Russia to govern any part of the country And I hope the EU & every NATO nation will do the same
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,This is the most dangerous moment in 60 years #Putin’s is facing a humiliating military fiasco & he has triggered extraordinary consequences on #Russia’s economy & people that will not be easy to reverse And his only options to reset this imbalance are catastrophic ones
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,"No matter how many cities his takes, #Putin will never win in #Ukraine Berdyansk right now shows the people will NEVER accept occupation or puppet government leaders"
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,Brace yourselves The images and videos from #Kharkiv of the war crimes committed by #Putin will shock & outrage the world
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,Understand for #Putin being seeing as “strong” is essential #UkraineRussiaWar has been humiliating He is using cluster bombs & other terror tactics to break the will to resist
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,DANGER #Putin’s legitimacy built on image as the strong leader who restored #Russia to superpower after the disasters of the 90’s Now the economy is in shambles & the military is being humiliated & his only tools to reestablish power balance with the West is cyber & nukes
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,"Growing signs #Putin has ordered a medieval siege of #Kyiv Cut a city of millions off from food, fuel, power, communications & supplies & then bomb & starve the govt into submission We need to start thinking about what we can & are willing to do to prevent such a barbaric crime"
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,#Putin’s central goal is to turn most of #Ukraine into Belarus But no matter how many cities his military occupies or destroys Ukrainians will never accept a puppet government or their country becoming a vassal state of #Russia
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,#Ukraine inflicting substantial damage on #Russia’s supply lines with Bayraktar TB2 Turkish made unmanned combat aerial vehicles
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,The horrifying strikes by #Putin invaders are increasingly being captured on live feeds & cell phone videos Less documented is how his convoys are being repeatedly ambushed & destroyed even in areas #Russia “controls”
@marcorubio,2/28/2022,This is the right decision But be aware if #Russia vessels try to test this the probability of a dangerous naval confrontation with NATO is very high
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"#Russia movements provide insight into their plan to encircle #Kyiv The mission from #Sumy & #Chernihiv is to eventually control east Kyiv,moving cautiously to evade major resistance The mission from north is ASAP control of west Kyiv,so they are moving far more aggressively"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,#Kherson is under withering assault Expect #Russia to go to great lengths to prevent news & images to emerge because the world will be horrified by the crimes they are committing there
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,No matter what happens #Putin loses His economy is melting down His military will continue to suffer historic losses And he will either be drained by a long protracted & costly occupation or leave behind a puppet government #Ukraine will overthrow
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,#Russia is moving to quickly choke off supplies to #Kyiv by sealing off the western part of the city Remember all the material being sent to #Ukraine has to come across the border and from the western part of the country
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"#Putin is a criminal,a murderer and an authoritarian thug who must be stopped And long term #China is 50 times more dangerous"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"Maybe #Putin takes #Kyiv, but he will NEVER conquer #Ukraine He isn’t just fighting against a military he is fighting against over 40 million people And they won’t stop killing #Russia’s invaders until all of them are gone"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,No matter how many cities #Putin takes he will never pacify 40 million Ukrainians We should provide them weapons to keep eliminating the Russian occupiers until they leave And then we should help them overthrow & bring to justice the traitorous puppets #Russia leaves behind
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,#Putin isn’t fighting just a military in #Ukraine He is fighting over 40 millions people in a war that will never end and he can never win
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"This @DefenceHQ map helps reveal #Putin’s plan: 1. Belarus axis pushing hard to cut off West #Kyiv ASAP 2. Chernihiv,Konostop & Sumy axis moving to eventually cut off East Kyiv 3. Mykolaiv axis will eventually plunge deep into Western #Ukraine"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,Under Joe Biden the U.S. is producing about 1.2 million fewer barrels oil per day That is $100 million every day from your pocket to criminals like #Putin Tonight Biden should announce we are going to reverse this
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,#Putin allies like the #MaduroRegime in #Venezuela & the #CastroRegime in #Cuba are enablers and supporters of war crimes & atrocities being committed by #Russia military in #Ukraine
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,At best #Putin will achieve a very costly military victory At worst he will find himself in a long & painful quagmire But he will NEVER be able to install a puppet govt he can leave behind And he can no longer avoid the severe economic crisis his crimes brought upon #Russia
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"#Russia seems to have established effective control over access to #Kharkiv from the SW, NE & NW. Now they are relying on war crimes to take the SE"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,#Putin can’t win This will either be a costly military victory followed by a painful never ending insurgency Or it will be a protracted military quagmire The DANGER is that at some point he will need to escalate to reset the strategic balance with the West
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"With #Kharkiv sealed from NE, NW and SW, attacks on #Chuhuiv part of #Putin push to cut off the city from the SE"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,"We need to start thinking about what we are willing to do if #Putin traps & tries to starve 3 million human beings by imposing a medieval siege on #Kyiv And I don’t assume or pretend our options are easy,simple or without risk"
@marcorubio,3/1/2022,The long Russian line is a heavily armed traffic jam They are facing logistical challenges & being attacked by a military & harassed by an population with the will to fight But also be aware that in Syria they showed an ability to learn from setbacks & make adjustments
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,#Putin only has a few options to lash out against America One of them is cyber attacks The private sector & state/local govts are the front lines of our cyber defense.   Go to @CISAgov’s “Shields Up” to prepare or report suspicious cyber activity.
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,In 6 days #Putin has done more damage to #Russia than America ever could
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,Since #China supports recognizing the independence of Russian puppets in #Ukraine maybe its time the world supports the independence of the legitimate government of #Taiwan
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"#Putin sent 200k troops & is willing to commit war crimes,so eventually he’ll take some cities But that doesn’t mean he is winning He didn’t invade to take #Kherson #Mariupol or #Kharkiv He invaded to turn #Ukraine into a vassal state like Belarus And that will NEVER happen"
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"Tonight #Putin has launched what appears to be the largest airborne assault of the invasion It is likely a final push to take control of the SE approach to #Kharkiv, a city he expected to take quickly without resistance & be welcomed by grateful residents as a liberator"
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,DANGER We can’t stop the crowdsourcing of retribution against #Putin But be aware he will think these groups are fronts for the U.S. government & retaliate against us It is imperative that EVERYONE prepare for & report suspicious cyber activity ASAP
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,In western #Russia #Putin has deployed 42 An-2 “Colt” biplanes & a 300% increase in combat aircraft There are indications the “Colts” may have been converted to drones for use as decoys to trigger an air defense response from #Ukraine that would identify their location
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,What part of the speech will Biden announce we are going to replace #oil from #Russia with oil from America?
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,At this very moment in #Mariupol #Ukraine brave heroes are surrounded by invading enemies & making a valiant stand for freedom. Pray for them.
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,A week ago this was a normal town in a modern country Now an cruel & evil butcher named Vladimir Putin has turned it into a hellscape
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"I will say this twice a day No matter how many cities #Putin occupies or destroys he will NEVER win At best he will achieve a costly military victory followed by an even costlier long term occupation & committed insurgency At worst,he will be trapped in a humiliating quagmire"
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,Even the doors in #Ukraine are putting up stiff resistance to #Putin’s invaders
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,For #Putin “negotiations” are just another weapon in his arsenal. He uses them to inflict harm on his opponent and improve his position.
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,The @DefenceHQ situation map with additions in red #Putin continues to desperately try & seize control of Western #Kyiv Three axis groups moving more deliberately to seize control of East Kyiv It appears Axis in #Mykolaiv poised to make dart deep into Western #Ukraine
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,The economy of #Russia is in a rapid & astonishing free fall And #Putin has few options to quickly reverse it It’s going to get ugly very fast
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"#Russia now admits 498 of their invaders have died in #Ukraine That means the real death toll is, at a minimum, at least 4x that amount"
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"I don’t understand why Biden says it’s too early to say #Putin is committing war crimes If he says #Russia is using banned weapons,intentionally killing civilians & unnecessarily destroying civilian property then it’s clear he is committing war crimes"
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,The @USAmbUN says: “#Russia has bombed residential apartment buildings. It has bombed sacred burial grounds. It has shelled kindergartens & orphanages & hospitals.” But @POTUS says: It’s “too early” to say war crimes have been committed?
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,The criminal dictatorships in #Cuba #Venezuela & #Nicaragua are enablers of #Putin’s war crimes in the #UkraineWar
@marcorubio,3/2/2022,"Many potential long term consequences to #UkraineInvasion For example,I wonder how many countries see what #Putin is doing to #Ukraine & thinking “this is what happens when a country doesn’t have nuclear weapons”"
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,Expect the unexpected #Russia’s military doctrine considers information a vital combat domain And they have spent years developing and perfecting the ability to release #deepfake videos to sap an adversaries will to fight & sow confusion and division in other nations
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,The Russian economy is headed for depression & the quality of life is rapidly deteriorating #Putin has ordered that tomorrow every school in #Russia teach the “truth” about the “liberation mission”in #Ukraine And longtime observers are now predicting martial law may be next
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,#Russia’s economy is collapsing And they are headed for either a costly military victory & occupation or a long military quagmire At some point #Putin will need to reestablish leverage against the West & the only escalation options he has available to him are very dangerous
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,Something to keep an eye on After being unable to make progress for close to 72 hours #Putin’s massive military column stuck 15 miles outside #Kyiv is beginning to show a growing decline in readiness
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,Growing signs the people of #Russia are becoming increasingly aware of the scale & scope of the #UkraineRussianWar If so this would put #Putin in danger of a two front conflict He would move quickly to impose restrictions aimed at preventing large protests & unrest
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,"The Soviets lost 13,000 soldiers over a decade during and after the invasion of Afghanistan #Putin could lose 13,000 after just 5 to 7 weeks in #Ukraine"
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,"Today and everyday for the foreseeable future America will buy 600,000 barrels of oil from the butcher #Putin Lets stop buying oil of #Russia and replace it with oil we produce right here in America"
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,Inside of #Russia the once unimaginable is now possible The quality of life is rapidly deteriorating Everyone who can afford to leave is leaving And increasingly people are realizing that #Putin has plunged them into a full scale war in #Ukraine & destroyed their economy
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,#Putin faces: -either a costly military victory/occupation or a quagmire -increasing domestic unrest over a full scale war & economic meltdown He will respond with: - a horrifying escalation in #Ukraine; &/or - creating a new crisis;and - Stalinist restrictions in #Russia
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,IMPORTANT WARNING In 2018 #Putin used propaganda war to blame rebels for Assad’s chemical weapons attacks High probability he could carry out real or staged biological/chemical attacks in #Ukraine & blame it on NATO or Ukrainian forces
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,The chances of #Belarus joining in the invasion of #Ukraine are very high and (in my opinion) near certain
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,Russian convoy just south of #Hostomel & NW of #Kyiv has been stationary for several days with soldiers sleeping outdoors on the ground and eating expired rations
@marcorubio,3/3/2022,"#Russia is obviously a major military power, but they don’t have an unlimited supply of guided rockets & missiles For the first time there are indications they are reaching the number set aside for this invasion"
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,#Russian invaders are shelling the largest nuke plant in Europe Reports now that portions of the plant are now on fire

@marcorubio,3/4/2022,"#Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in #Ukraine has 6 reactors, is the largest one in all of Europe, and the 9th largest on earth #Russia is currently attacking it with mortars and RPGs Portions of the plan are currently on fire Russians firing on the Firefighters too"
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,#Russian soldiers have entered in nuclear plant in #Ukraine There is an growing fire on the site and now a firefight occurring inside the 9th largest nuclear power plant in the world.
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,Russian soldiers have breached the main building of the #Zaporizhzhia nuke plant in #Ukraine Active firefight is going on inside a facility that is already on fire and controls 6 reactors Firefighters unable to fight the fire because they are in the middle of a combat zone
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,Like most nuke plants the one in #Ukraine under attack is built to withstand a direct hit from an airplane crash The problem is a loss of power or a shell draining the pools used to store spent fuel If that fuel isn’t cooled it can melt & release large amounts of radioactivity
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,#Ukraine energy officials telling the media and U.S. officials that elevated radiation levels are being detected at #Zaporizhzhia There is no independent confirmation of this nor are any levels being provided or available at the moment
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,Ukrainian TV is reporting that a reactor is on fire at #Zaporizhzhia but that it is not currently operating But it does have nuclear fuel inside
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,Second Ukraine official just now says reactor was “hit” & is inactive with fuel inside but that its the admin building which is on fire He had received no information about elevated radiation levels Says meltdown unlikely but leak is possible No other verified info available
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,"There is all sorts of contradictory information from officials in #Ukraine This is understandable given the fact their country is being invaded and at war An accurate damage assessment and determination about the danger of a leak, if any, will not be available for hours"
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,"It would be a catastrophic mistake to make decisions based on the #Putin of the past The sense of grievance,the suspicions,the hubris of viewing himself as #Russia the obsession with control, have all gotten worse & he will do things now he would have never done before"
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,"I can’t emphasize enough how much #Putin & his risk calculus have changed He will push Belarus into war,use chemical or biological weapons,slaughter millions & impose Stalinist restrictions in #Russia to avoid humiliation or the perception that he was forced to back down"
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,There will be a steady increase of internal restrictions in #Russia over the next few days In less than a week Russians will be living under Stalin era rules
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,President Biden and NATO need to make clear to #Belarus that it would be a terrible mistake to send troops into #Ukraine Prudence limits our options against #Russia Belarus is not Russia
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,In many of the areas #Russia has “control” they are facing costly hit & run operations & ambushes that are complicating their ability to move supplies & reinforcements
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,Biden will not allow America to produce more of its own oil But we are still buying oil from a war criminal in #Russia And are apparently only days away from also buying oil from a terrorist government in #Iran
@marcorubio,3/4/2022,"#Ukraine says they have retaken the military air field at #Mykolaiv in the south 60km north of the Black Sea A reminder that one thing is for #Russia to “take” a territory, another is to hold it."
@marcorubio,3/5/2022,Growing indications that #Russia faces some kind of imminent supply crisis in #Ukraine If this is the case we could see a dramatic escalation of attacks over the new 72 hours

@marcorubio,3/6/2022,This is the week that proved that being dependent on a criminal like #Putin for our oil is a bigger threat to America than climate change
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,#Russia’s invaders are facing a dire logistical and resupply crisis in northern #Ukraine It’s almost at a tipping point now

@marcorubio,3/6/2022,#Russia isn’t a economic superpower or a conventional military superpower #Putin’s geopolitical power is entirely built on Nuclear Weapons & being a major exporter of oil & natural gas We can’t do much about the nukes But we can diminish the importance of his energy exports
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,"#Putin uses everything, even humanitarian corridors as a weapon I pray efforts like those supposed to happen today in #Mariupol are successful But I fear #Russia will use them as an opportunity to stage false flag attacks on civilians & blame it on #Ukraine & NATO"
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,#Russia spent 8 missiles on a singe airport in #Vinnytsya #Ukraine and reportedly completely destroyed it They know you can’t send fighter jets to Ukraine if they don’t have somewhere to land & operate them from
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,Terrible conditions right now in #Mariupol Teetering on the verge of humanitarian cataclysm If #Russia is struggling to feed & supply their own troops just imagine how terrible conditions are for civilians
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,#Putin is targeting civilian populations (just like they did in Syria & Chechnya) to terrorize the population into fleeing or submitting #Russia is facing dire supply & logistical challenges so we will see an increase in these horrifying tactics
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,Growing probability that #Russia will expand the #Ukraine invasion to involve the separatist Moldovan region of #Transnistria
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,"In addition to 1.5 million refugees there are roughly 200,000 people who have had to flee one part of #Ukraine for another This is mothers & children whose husbands,fathers & brothers stayed behind to fight & have no home or jobs to return to when the war ends"
@marcorubio,3/6/2022,Censorship may limit what many Russians know about what #Russia is doing in #Ukraine But #Putin will not be able to hide the mounting casualties from Russian families
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,For years the West underestimated what #Putin would be willing to do
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,We need to replace the oil we buy from #Russia with American oil Why are we helping pay for #Putin’s war crimes?
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,If God forbid there are any chemical or biological weapons used or any nuclear incidents in #Ukraine have zero doubt who is behind it
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,"10 days into #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine one thing is obvious for all to see, #Putin will never be able to successfully occupy & govern the country As long as Russians are there, they will face bombs, snipers and death"
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,#Biden secret talks with #MaduroRegime isn’t about replacing #Russia’s oil #Venezuela’s oil industry is an incompetent mess that produces 10% of what Russia exports Ukraine is just an excuse for pro-leftist former Obama staffers who already wanted to get close to Maduro & Cuba
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,"Like I said a week ago, #Russia has been planning a CBW and/or nuclear false flag in #Ukraine Well now #Putin govt is falsely reporting that Ukraine has rigged a reactor in #Kharkov ANY NUKE,CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL INCIDENT IN UKRAINE IS A RUSSIAN FALSE FLAG"
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,"STATUS REPORT Now on day 11 of #Putin’s criminal invasion of #Ukraine: -troops stuck & running out of supplies NE & N of #Kyiv -they keep losing tanks,planes,helo’s & soldiers -economy in free fall -country an international pariah state -using “ceasefires”to kill civilians"
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,#Putin has a long history of terrorizing local populations to break their spirit & will to resist That is why you see #Russia bombing civilian areas & taking advantage of ceasefires to use snipers to kill fleeing innocents
@marcorubio,3/7/2022,#Putin would not hesitate to stage or carry out a biological weapon false flag in #Ukraine and this is the kind of messaging you would see as a prelude to him doing that
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,"#Putin now has a substantial majority of his total conventional military forces deployed inside of #Ukraine If enough of these deployed assets are captured, destroyed or stuck there, #Russia will be left vulnerable along all its other borders for a long time"
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,#Ukraine is a complicated & unpredictable crisis #Putin is facing either a costly military victory & occupation or a quagmire His economy is falling & discontent is rising And if this invasion ends in humiliation or the perception he backed down he will be removed from power
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,I am glad Biden finally cut off the oil from #Russia Now replace it with American oil
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,In the areas of #Ukraine that #Russia now “controls” their military units are in need of reinforcement & they face a hostile population & constant ambushes of long supply lines This is increasingly forcing them to pick between new advances & holding on to areas they “control”
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,DANGER!!! This is how #Russia sets up false flags If there is a biological weapons incident in #Ukraine be 100% certain its the Russians who did it
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,#Putin knew we was going to get sanctioned after he invaded He was planning on using #Russia’s reserves as a buffer But according to @StateDept virtually all of their foreign currency reserves are frozen & inaccessible to them
@marcorubio,3/8/2022,#Putin believes his destiny is to restore #Russia as a great power He believes they can’t be a great power without #Ukraine & invasion was the only way to achieve it He expected little resistance & quick victory And now he realizes he’s in trouble if he is seen as backing down
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,#Putin doesn’t have many economic weapons at his disposal But he has a few: - @Boeing⁩ buys much of its titanium from #Russia - #India gets much of its fertilizer from Russia -#Egypt & #Lebanon get much of their wheat from Russia & #Ukraine
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,Perhaps as part of our aid package for #Ukraine we should also throw in a few more @JohnDeere tractors!
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,At some point #Putin will start targeting the supply convoys bringing weapons & aid once they cross over into #Ukraine This could bring #Russia’s missiles & aircraft in very close proximity to deployed NATO forces in #Poland
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,#Putin doesn’t get a veto over our decisions And we must help #Ukraine defend itself from a barbaric invasion But we must never allow ourselves to lose sight of the fact that a war between NATO & #Russia will produce the most horrific moment in human history
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,"Many in the West still don’t understand that #Putin is an expert liar He doesn’t care about “humanitarian”relief,if in fact there is a “ceasefire”it’s because he sees some strategic or tactical benefit And beware of attacks on refugees #Russia blames on #Ukraine or NATO"
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,#Putin has no problem hitting a maternity hospital in #Mariupol Because his goal is to force local officials to surrender their cities to him in the name of avoiding a massacre and complete destruction
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,"#Russia is making costly progress in their effort to mass troops to the North,West & East of #Kyiv & have destroyed supply routes to the city from the SW But access & resupply remains largely uncontested from the south"
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,Want to know where #Putin strikes next? Then understand how he defines the “Greater Russia” he believes is his destiny to restore First #Belarus Then #Ukraine After that #Armenia & #Moldova
@marcorubio,3/9/2022,I have mentioned this every day for a week for a reason #Russia is doing everything it has done in the past when they have set up a biological or chemical false flag
@marcorubio,3/10/2022,"Latest map shows #Russia’s adjusted strategic goals: 1. Expand encirclement of #Kyiv from W,N & E 2. Stage for offensive on Odessa 3. Seize Mariupol 4. Convince local officials in Chernihiv,Kharkiv,Mykolayiv & Zaporizhia to either surrender these cities or face annihilation"
@marcorubio,3/10/2022,Things will start to turn soon inside of #Russia The inability to import will being to paralyze manufacturing And as more businesses close unemployment will quickly rise #Putin may be able to lie to them about #Ukraine but he won’t be able to hide the truth about the economy
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,#Russia aim over next 24-48 hours: 1. Complete the perimeter NE of #Kyiv to encircle #Ukraine troops in #Chernihiv 2. Link forces down in southeast of Ukraine to encircle resistance in #Mariupol In 15 days they have over half the KIA’s as they did in 10 years in Afghanistan
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,#Putin appears to have abandoned initial plan of installing puppet leaders in #Ukraine New plan appears to be: - encircle & pound on #Kyiv #Chernihiv #Kharkiv #Mylolayiv & #Zaporizhzhya -seize #Mariupol & #Odessa -wear down Ukraine’s military -then dictate terms for ending war
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,"We should have passed funding for Ukraine 2 weeks ago. But instead,Democrats held it hostage so it could ram through thousands of earmarks,green new deal programs,the hiring of 10000 IRS agents & other woke priorities buried in thousands of pages.This is a ridiculous process."
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,Right now #Russia can’t fully encircle much less take #Kyiv They have lost at least 7k soldiers & entire units have been wiped out Some were forward deployed in November for exercises & are in desperate need of retrofit And they packed for a quick victory not a protracted war
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,Putin didn’t invade until Feb 24th The record setting February inflation is on Joe Biden
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,Why did inflation grow at record pace & much faster than your paycheck BEFORE PUTIN INVASION? Because more demand than supply Demand exploded after Biden rammed $1.9 trillion of govt cash into the economy in March 2021 Not enough supply because of Covid shutdowns & disruptions
@marcorubio,3/11/2022,Today #Russia conducted missiles strikes on airfields in Western #Ukraine to prevent them from being used for resupply flights or staging new jets As I mentioned 2 days ago this phase brings attacks closer to NATO One of the strikes was just 70 miles from the Polish border
@marcorubio,3/12/2022,Heavy attacks right now on #Kyiv The new #Putin strategy: - isolate several cities & unleash constant artillery & rocket attack -cut off supplies from the West -degrade #Ukraine’s military Then once he feels he has established leverage offer his terms for a cease fire
@marcorubio,3/12/2022,#Poland is taking in millions & #Hungary hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing a legitimate totalitarian war criminal But the E.U somehow thinks now is a good time to impose financial penalties on them for now meeting their definition of “democracy”
@marcorubio,3/12/2022,It is time to start preparing for the fact that #Putin’s criminal invasion of one of the worlds leading wheat producers is going to result in a massive increase in food prices including here in America & a food insecurity crisis in many parts of the world
@marcorubio,3/12/2022,I warned 4 days ago #Putin would soon start targeting supply convoys to #Ukraine Now #Russia is openly threatening to do so I hope Biden is making it clear to #Putin that harming a single American soldier would be the worst decision he has ever made
@marcorubio,3/12/2022,"See below the new #Putin strategy I outlined 3 days ago Part of the new strategy to is isolate various cities,including #Mykolayiv & force local officials to surrender & cooperate or face annihilation"
@marcorubio,3/13/2022,"Excellent and highly accurate map from @KyivIndependent Problem #Russia faces is they can’t close off southern approach to #Kyiv to prevent resupply But they can assault Kyiv relentlessly around the clock along these West, NW and NE lines"
@marcorubio,3/13/2022,Multiple strikes by #Russia in western #Ukraine in late 72 hours part of their plan to target & discourage weapons being supplied across border with #Poland Latest strikes were less than 12 miles from NATO forces
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,I would be worried if I was a high ranking military official in #Russia because #Putin must be wondering how this is what you get from 20 years worth of massive increases in defense spending
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,#Putin still enjoys considerable support inside #Russia In many ways because the Kremlin controls virtually all the information they receive But check back in a couple of weeks
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,#Russia has refitted forces and will move aggressively over the next few days in the south of #Ukraine But right now they have neither the manpower nor the troop morale to take #Kyiv or many other areas in the north
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,It’s possible that by the end of this month more Russian soldiers will have died in #Ukraine in 6 weeks than did over 10 years in Afghanistan
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,It’s possible that by the end of this month more Russian soldiers will have died in #Ukraine in 6 weeks than did over 10 years in Afghanistan
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,"There is verified evidence of a Russian troop morale crisis Of soldiers & pilots refusing orders There are certainly sadists among them But there are also many who are increasingly unwilling to murder civilians,especially in a country so close & culturally familiar to them"
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,"New #Russia strategy I previewed last week now in full effect - control coastal cities - isolate cities in north & target with artillery,missiles & heavy bombers - disrupt supplies from West - degrade #Ukraine military - then at some point propose cease fire on #Putin’s terms"
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,#Putin still wants to capture #Kyiv & install a puppet govt But when he realizes that’s not feasible he will: 1. Focus on destroying as much of @DefenceU as possible 2. Then offer cease fire that imposes neutrality on #Ukraine & recognizes #Crimea & #Donbas as part of #Russia
@marcorubio,3/15/2022,Today may be the day #Russia make its move on #Odessa Capturing an arc stretching from Odessa through #Crimea & into the #Donbass is now their top military objective Allows #Putin to make the Black Sea a #Russian lake And leaves him on the border of #Romania & #Moldova
@marcorubio,3/16/2022,According to this report #Russia just put out a #DeepFake address by the President of #Ukraine Zelenskyi on Ukraine 24 TV channel calling on the Armed Forces of Ukraine to lay down their arms
@marcorubio,3/16/2022,#Russia trying to: 1. Gain control of territory they want to annex in any future cease fire “deal”(Red) 2. Gain control of key routes into #Kyiv - MO1(Yellow) connecting from #Chernihiv - MO5(Blue) which is primary resupply route 3. Target #Ukraine defense industry sites
@marcorubio,3/16/2022,If/when Putin concludes he can’t remove Zelenskyi he will seek clear battlefield dominance through barbaric escalation & then try to force Ukraine to: =surrender land (yellow) =adopt neutrality in constitution =demilitarize =install Russian puppet in a high government post
@marcorubio,3/16/2022,In every previous conflict #Putin has dealt with military setbacks by using escalation to achieve his battlefield objectives And just now he murdered at least 10 innocent people standing in a bread line in #Chernihiv as part of that escalation
@marcorubio,3/17/2022,#Putin is going to take an L in #Ukraine A strategic loss is certain and even an operational loss is possible
@marcorubio,3/17/2022,Now our focus should be to do everything we can to help #Ukraine defeat #Putin
@marcorubio,3/18/2022,"As we unfortunately learned here in the U.S., wars are expensive #Putin can’t afford a long & costly war much less a long & costly occupation They won’t even be able to pay the $600 million in debt service they owe IN DOLLARS before the end of this month"
@marcorubio,3/19/2022,The new #RussianUkrainianWar plan I tweeted about a week ago is now fully evident on the battlefield They are now digging trenches around the cities they seek to encircle and literally digging in for a longer term conflict
@marcorubio,3/21/2022,"In a war with plenty of heroism the single most inspiring stand so far may be the one happening right now in #Mariupol Defenders were surrounded,cut-off from resupply & refused offers to surrender"
@marcorubio,3/21/2022,"As I have been saying now for 10 days the #Putin plan is no longer to take over most of #Ukraine The plan is to annex coastal south,lay siege to #Kyiv & 5 cities in North,degrade Ukraines military & factories & then offer cease fire on terms he will claim are a strategic victory"
@marcorubio,3/22/2022,"URGENT: Because U.S. business will be the target of a #Putin cyber-attack they will be the first to know its underway Oil/Gas,telecomm & banks should be on especially high alert & report incidents to @CISAgov ASAP! EVERYONE should get their #ShieldsUP"
@marcorubio,3/22/2022,#Putin’s goal in #Ukraine now is: 1.Establish leverage by capturing coast & encircling 6 key cities 2.Degrade Ukraine’s defense industry & military 3.Then offer to “cease fire” if Ukraine: - Demilitarizes - Puts neutrality in constitution;& - Forfeits Donbas & Crimea
@marcorubio,3/22/2022,At some point soon #Putin will have to begin to target the supply convoys coming into #Ukraine And the risk that this would lead to an attack against NATO forces inside of #Poland due to mistakes & miscalculation are significant
@marcorubio,3/23/2022,Big corporate lobbying 40 years ago led to Europe dangerous dependence on #Russia’s natural gas today Big corporate lobbying now threatens to leave us dangerously dependent on the Communist Party of #China for decades
@marcorubio,3/23/2022,#Russia trying to make a final decisive push on #Marioupol One day everyone will hear the incredible stories of the brave men defending the city right now against all the odds
@marcorubio,3/23/2022,"Overall #Russia’s continues with the same strategy: =trying to isolate & use firepower advantage against key cities while giving troops time to refit,resupply & rest =using stand-off strikes to try & weaken #Kyiv’s defenses =preparing to try again to make advances in Donbas"
@marcorubio,3/23/2022,"My daily reminder of #Putin’s new strategy: 1. First, gain negotiating leverage by creating a battlefield advantage & degrading #Ukraine’s military 2. Then offer “deal” if Ukraine: - demilitarizes - Become a “neutral state” - Surrenders Donbas & much of south"
@marcorubio,3/23/2022,"#Putin’s need to create negotiating leverage means over the next 10-15 days we face the growing possibility of #Russia conducting: = chemical &/or biological attack they would try to blame on #Ukraine &/or #NATO = cyber attack on U.S. banking,technology &/or energy sector"
@marcorubio,3/25/2022,The suffering in #Ukraine because of the war criminal #Putin is obvious to all But the dangers that lie ahead are far greater than most realize
@marcorubio,3/25/2022,two weeks ago I responded to a tweet about Russians being 9 miles outside of #Kyiv with the RT below pointing out they were running the risk of getting encircled Very happy to see the possibility of that happening is increasing
@marcorubio,3/25/2022,"To force #Ukraine into deal he can claim as a victory #Putin needs battlefield momentum The danger now is that he has no economic or diplomatic cards to play,his conventional forces are stalled & cyber,chemical,biological & non-strategic nukes are his only escalation options"
@marcorubio,3/25/2022,"If Biden is serious about helping break dependence on Russia’s LNG he will support my bill filed a week before the invasion that would expedite exports to NATO,Ukraine,Taiwan,Australia,South Korea,Israel,Japan,New Zealand,Cyprus,Finland,Moldova & Sweden"
@marcorubio,3/29/2022,At 9 a.m. today I will be speaking on Putin’s War and the Threat from Communist China:
@marcorubio,3/30/2022,"As I tweeted 2 weeks ago, #Putin has a new plan It’s to annex #Kharkiv, #Donbas and the southern coast #Russia isn’t leaving #Ukraine These troops are simply regrouping and will return very soon to concentrate on those areas"
@marcorubio,4/5/2022,#Putin felt confident invading #Ukraine because Europe depends on energy from #Russia Even worse awaits the world if the U.S. doesn’t end its dangerous dependence on #China
@marcorubio,4/26/2022,"Since Democrats took over 15 months ago, inflation wiped out pay increases,our southern border was overun, criminals have no fear, the Taliban took Afghanistan, Putin invaded Ukraine, China openly mocks us & free speech was replaced by political correctness"
