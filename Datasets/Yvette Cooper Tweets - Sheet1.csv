@YvetteCooperMP,2/26/22,"Ukraine is under fire. People are fleeing war Yet Home Office still applies normal visa restrictions inc salaries, language, close relatives This isn’t solidarity w Ukraine, it’s immoral Govt must urgently provide simple sanctuary route to UK for Ukrainians who need our help"
@YvetteCooperMP,2/27/22,"My God. People are fleeing war in Europe, the like we haven’t seen in generations, in search of swift sanctuary. Yet the immigration minister says the answer is they should put in an application to pick Britain’s fruit & veg."
@YvetteCooperMP,2/27/22,"Right that Immigration Minister has deleted tweet saying Ukrainians can come pick UK fruit. But still no answers from @pritipatel to my Qs. Problem remains. Home Office is restricting Ukrainians to current visas with high hurdles & delays. That’s not sanctuary, it’s shameful"
@YvetteCooperMP,2/27/22,"This is a first step which will help desperate families, tho delays in doing this have been very damaging But Govt must clarify it includes wider family not just closest relatives And must set out wider sanctuary plan working w other countries so UK does its bit to help Ukraine"
@YvetteCooperMP,2/27/22,Shameful of Govt to refuse to even help other relatives in a terrible European war like this. Home Office must immediately extend this to wider family members and then they must set out a broader sanctuary route so UK also does its bit to help other Ukrainians too/2
@YvetteCooperMP,2/27/22,"Updated guidance just published by Home Office shows even this first step does NOT apply to wider family. What are they thinking? What about people struggling to get elderly parents here, or Ukrainians who can’t come stay with sister or brother here?"
@YvetteCooperMP,2/28/22,"This is totally chaotic. Those who are urgently seeking sanctuary or to rejoin relatives, and their family & friends who are worried for them, need clear answers. They deserve better than this"
@YvetteCooperMP,2/28/22,But she remains in Paris. @ukhomeoffice says only immediate family (spouses/partners/children u18/people needing care) are covered in family rules after all & not elderly parents. Deeply distressing for families. Why are elderly parents fleeing war in Ukraine being turned away?
@YvetteCooperMP,2/28/22,Real confusion on Home Office sanctuary rules for Ukraine. I asked @pritipatel today if elderly parents were included in family arrangements & if the elderly Ukrainian widow turned away from Eurostar by Border Force at weekend can now join her daughter. She said yes.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/1/22,Very glad Valentyna Klymova is now able to join her daughter in UK after I raised her case in Parliament yesterday. Elderly parents from Ukraine shd not be turned away by Border Force. Govt has finally accepted this but there’s still more to do to help those needing sanctuary.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/1/22,The Ukrainian people are showing great courage and strength in the face of an appalling Russian onslaught and we need to support them - including through giving sanctuary to people fleeing war in Europe as we have done in generations past.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/1/22,Govt has announced a humanitarian sponsorship scheme but no resettlement scheme & we await further details. The existing community sponsorship scheme is a very good thing but is slow and small scale. How will this be different? Seeking info on how quickly it will be in place.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/1/22,Today Govt finally agreed to let elderly parents from Ukraine join family in UK. It was very wrong to turn them away & is relief they can come now. But still many Qs on Govt plans plus real concerns about gaps & delays & if much needed sanctuary will be delivered in practice
@YvetteCooperMP,3/2/22,So very glad at this. Welcome Valentyna
@YvetteCooperMP,3/3/22,"Also real concerns that some Ukrainians who were already here & cannot now return home could be charged over £1,000 by the Home Office to be able to stay. That’s deeply wrong. Those in need of sanctuary shouldn’t have to pay to stay safe in the UK."
@YvetteCooperMP,3/3/22,Home Secretary announced on Tuesday that elderly relatives & siblings from Ukraine are welcome here. But guidance now shows it doesn’t start til Friday. People are fleeing war in Europe. Why does Home Office still not understand the urgency of crisis?
@YvetteCooperMP,3/3/22,"Still no detail on new sponsorship scheme or when it will be published. For info; existing community sponsorship scheme isn’t fast. Helped 500 refugees over 5 yrs. Sponsors need £9k in bank, prepare resettlement plans, get training & approval. Doesn’t meet urgency of crisis."
@YvetteCooperMP,3/4/22,Too many gaps & delays in Home Office help for Ukraine Family members still excluded No sign of sponsorship scheme People need urgent help now We’re calling on Government to introduce Emergency Protection Visas to end delays & help people reach UK
@YvetteCooperMP,3/4/22,Deeply wrong for UK to turn Ukrainians away just because their family member hasn’t lived here for long enough. There’s a war in Europe. We must do our bit to help. Govt must change this. Set up Emergency Protection Visas to help more people fast
@YvetteCooperMP,3/6/22,Total disgrace. Why are these desperate Ukrainian women & children who are fleeing war & trying to join British relatives still being blocked rather than helped by the UK Home Office? Have Government Ministers lost all humanity & solidarity?
@YvetteCooperMP,3/6/22,Shocking - Ukrainian families turned away by UK at Calais & told to go back to Paris for a visa. Priti Patel needs to get a grip. Send an emergency @ukhomeoffice team to Calais immediately to sort this out today & get desperate people swiftly through.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/6/22,Only 50 visas granted under the Ukrainian Family Scheme even though thousands of relatives have applied. This is too slow. Too many hoops for desperate families to have to jump through. Home Office completely failing to understand urgency of crisis
@YvetteCooperMP,3/7/22,"Total chaos from Govt. This isn’t good enough. Families are struggling, being turned away or waiting days for visas. We need urgent action to get people to sanctuary in UK. Home Office were warned wks ago by British intelligence that an invasion was coming. Why didn’t they plan?"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/7/22,PM claims we have “two very generous routes already.” But one has only issued 50 visas. The other isn’t even open yet. This is total disgrace. Desperate Ukrainian families are being turned away & let down in their hour of need. Home Office needs to get a grip of this fast
@YvetteCooperMP,3/7/22,No sign of visa centre nr Calais the Home Sec told us had been set up. Families still being sent hundreds of miles back to Paris or Brussels People struggling to get appointments. Shameful & shambolic. Home Office is badly letting down Ukrainian families in their hour of need
@YvetteCooperMP,3/7/22,Home Office confirms tonight that only 300 Family Scheme Visas have been issued even tho thousands are trying to reach family. That’s shockingly low & painfully slow. Just 250 since yesterday. At this rate it would be weeks before many families reunite. Urgent action needed.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/8/22,Ukrainians who have fled Russian bombardment are still being turned away by UK. People are being sent hundreds of miles to visa centres which aren’t open or have no appointments til next week. This is shambolic & shameful. UK must act urgently to help people fleeing Ukraine
@YvetteCooperMP,3/9/22,Families with checks done in Rzeszow being told to now travel 200 miles to Warsaw to collect their visas. People who’ve made dangerous journeys from a war zone shouldn’t be sent from pillar to post before they can join family. Appalling that Home Secretary is letting this happen
@YvetteCooperMP,3/9/22,Good grief. Why is Priti Patel not sorting this out? Do people now have to go all the way to Calais before they can - maybe - be sent back to Lille? This is making it harder not easier for desperate Ukrainian families.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/10/22,* Lots of relatives still excluded. Ukrainian nurse on a work visa still can’t bring her family to UK. Home Sec says she’s “looking at it.” But war in Europe has been underway 2 weeks. Why can’t Home Office get their act together & reunite family? * Still no route for friends
@YvetteCooperMP,3/10/22,"* Even those using online applications will still have to jump hoops, eg upload marriage certificates in English etc. * Still unclear how long Home Office caseworkers will take to review all forms before issuing visa"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/10/22,* Still no explanation why Home Office isn’t accepting MoD offer of troops help to get cases thru * No action on long waits for people without passports/ online devices who still have to travel to existing visa centres. Why not set up extra centres with MoD help?
@YvetteCooperMP,3/10/22,"New changes will allow online applications & checks for Family Scheme visas for passport holders (similar to Hong Kong) But; * Changes don’t come in til Tues, visa centres still closed over weekend, lots of people still waiting days & days for urgent help"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/10/22,"Further changes to Family Visa scheme announced after we called Home Secretary to Commons again. Changes will be relief for many, but don’t yet go far enough. Will still be problems at Visa Centres & many ppl still excluded from help. Chaotic Govt response puts us to shame "
@YvetteCooperMP,3/14/22,Sajid Javid said on @BBCr4today that Ukrainian NHS staff on work visas can bring family to UK under Family Scheme. But Govt website says NO. Their families are still being turned away. Govt has repeatedly refused to include those families @pritipatel @sajidjavid Truly shameful
@YvetteCooperMP,3/22/22,Today Govt is asking Tory MPs to vote for amendments that could criminalise Ukrainian families who arrive in UK without proper papers & that reject the international Refugee Convention we expect other countries to abide by. This is shameful.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/22/22,"Tory Govt just voted to make it a criminal offence for Ukrainian families to arrive in UK without the right papers with a penalty of up to 4yrs in prison. At a time when British people have made clear we must help Ukraine, this is truly shameful. Our country is better than this"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/25/22,Shameful that the @ukhomeoffice visa system for Homes for Ukraine is still mired in so much bureaucracy & delay. How can they send a pregnant woman from pillar to post in this way after all the family has already been through?
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,"More than a month after Putin’s invasion, Home Office response to Ukrainian refugees is still shambolic & shamefully slow. Thousands of desperate people who fled war are mired in bureaucracy even tho British people want to help. What does it take for Priti Patel to get a grip?"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,For a month we’ve challenged Govt to sort out the private Visa Centres that are few & far between & only open part time. But desperate families still report long journeys & delays. Then there’s further delays as caseworkers review long bureaucratic forms.
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,"Tens of thousands more Ukrainians have started applications but not completed them. Because they are very long, require extra documents to be uploaded, & are only in English. Home Office seems to be making it as hard as possible for Ukrainians to apply."
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,"So yesterday they said there had been 38,000 applications for Ukraine Family Scheme. Today they claim there have only been 31,200.  Even allowing for removing duplications, thousands of cases have “disappeared”"
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,Home Office also trying to hide the full figures on visa applications. They aren’t including those who’ve filled in forms but are stuck waiting for Visa Centre appointments. That includes huge numbers of families as children often don’t have passports and can’t apply online
@YvetteCooperMP,3/30/22,Shamefully slow progress on Ukrainian refugees. British people shown strong support but shambolic Home Office bureaucracy letting everyone down. Tens of thousands of visa applications still outstanding. Just 1 in 100 Homes for Ukraine offers have visas
@YvetteCooperMP,3/31/22,Ministers & officials have now admitted that the basic checks can be done straight away. So why is the process still taking weeks? This is badly letting families down. What will it take for Ministers to sort this out?
@YvetteCooperMP,3/31/22,Home Office is still causing long delays for Ukrainian refugees. Thousands of desperate families who have applied are still waiting weeks & hearing nothing. Why is the Home Secretary so incapable of getting a grip on this?
@YvetteCooperMP,4/3/22,Reports & pictures coming out of Bucha are chilling - hard to comprehend this scale of cruelty & inhumanity against brave citizens of Ukraine.
@YvetteCooperMP,4/6/22,"This sums up disgrace & chaos of Priti Patel’s Home Office right now. Taking weeks to sort visas for Ukrainian refugees. Trying to send other refugees to Rwanda for case processing. Ignoring rising crime. Letting prosecutions plummet. Shameful, shambolic. Letting everyone down"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/6/22,"Some of Ukrainians waiting; - Disabled man still in Ukraine, afraid to start journey til sure he can get here  - Sick patient with UK hospital ready to provide urgent treatment - Mum & kids running out of money in hotel Truly shameful for Priti Patel to make them wait weeks"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/6/22,"Massive delays yet Home Office won’t tell us what’s going on. Website page is called 'transparency data' but data hasn't been updated in nearly a wk. Daily visa figures have been stopped. Far from transparent, this is a blatant attempt to hide failure"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/6/22,Thousands of Ukrainian families still waiting for visas after 2 1/2 weeks Mums & kids running out of money as they wait. Some still in bunkers in Ukraine. Priti Patel was urged to sort this weeks ago. Instead she’s covering up failure by hiding data & info.
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,"Priti Patel promised to speed up system yet a shocking 70% of Homes for Ukraine visas are still waiting. By 28/3 HO already accepted 28,300 visa applications. 10 days on only 12,200 granted. Some families have been waiting THREE WEEKS - often running out of money as they wait"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,"Over 30,000 Ukrainians with British sponsors still stuck in visa limbo - around half of them waiting more than ten days already. This is a total disgrace. Where is the Home Secretary? She needs to account for these scandalous & shameful delays that are letting everyone down"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,"Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are still in visa limbo even though there are British families waiting to help them. Half of them have been waiting more than 10 days already, some as long as 3 weeks. This shambles from the Home Office is a national disgrace"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,"Home Office must ditch the extra bureaucracy, cut the delays & get people here now. Priti Patel had months to plan, has been warned for 6 wks to sort it out. Making excuses about new systems taking time is shameful. There’s a war in Europe. Our country can do better than this"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,Ministers & officials admit security checks can be done in hours if not on the spot. So why the weeks of delays? Home Secretary chose to keep extra bureaucratic requirements Eg. Evidence of residency pre 1 Jan that then has to be reviewed by caseworkers causing extra delays.
@YvetteCooperMP,4/8/22,"Not good enough. We need action, not hollow words. Desperate families are waiting weeks & weeks because of Home Office bureaucracy. Home Secretary could cut that but she has chosen not to. It’s a total disgrace & letting families down
Ministers & officials admit security checks can be done in hours if not on the spot. So why the weeks of delays?"
@YvetteCooperMP,4/14/22,Refugees Minister last wk said “I’m having difficulty enough getting them from Ukraine... there’s no possibility of sending them to Rwanda”  Yet tonight’s Govt proposals wd mean Ukrainian refugees without visas cd be sent thousands of miles to Rwanda instead. Truly shameful
@YvetteCooperMP,4/27/22,"Families forced to cancel hard earned holidays, couples forced to abandon honeymoons, people giving up visits to loved ones due to long passport delays & another shambolic failure by Home Office Ministers to plan. I asked in Commons today - when will Ministers get a grip?"
@YvetteCooperMP,5/11/22,"Damaging bureaucratic delays on everything from Ukrainian visas to British passports Even the Prime Minister is giving up on the Home Office & asking MoD, DLUHP & private sector to take over. The Home Office is effectively in special measures. Britain deserves better than this"
@YvetteCooperMP,5/15/22,"We watch #Eurovision every year & normally by song 20 I’m forgetting which was which, but that was a great show. @SamRyderMusic brilliant. #Norway up there for me. But #Ukraine song & performance properly the heart of #Eurovision2022 This is the song I want to watch again"
